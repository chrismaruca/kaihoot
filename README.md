## 🚀 Inspiration
Kahoot? Fun. Making quizzes by hand? 🤢 Pain.
We saw the pain. We saw the opportunity. We said **"Let’s disrupt quizzes with AI."** 🤖🔥

## 🧠 What it does
**kaihoot** taps directly into your *live brainwaves* (ok, just audio + video) and **generates** real-time multiple choice questions while you teach.
Wanna keep your class awake? Push those AI-spawned questions straight to the squad. 📈
Post-lecture, kaihoot gives you a full vibe check: **transcripts**, **answer stats**, and a detailed breakdown of "who was cooked" vs "who was locked in."
Every lecture = a live AI-powered *game show*.

## 🛠️ How we built it
- **Next.js**, **Typescript**, **Firebase**, deployed at ludicrous speed via **Vercel** 🚀
- **Groq** + **distil-whisper-large-v3-en** for *blink-and-you’ll-miss-it* audio transcription ⚡
- **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** to rip open reality and craft quiz questions from thin air ✨
- Copilot? Yeah. More like **Co-founder** at this point. 🤝

## 😤 Challenges we ran into
We vibe-coded so hard the codebase literally begged for mercy.
Peak productivity. Peak entropy.

## 🏆 Accomplishments we're proud of
- AI-birthed Kahoot. No mortal hands involved.
- Accidentally made a better project than half of CS 35L. Oops.

## 🧪 What we learned
Vibe coding is not just a method.
It’s a **lifestyle**. ⚡💀

## 🚀 What's next for kaihoot!
🚨 **Pre-seed round opening soon.**
🚨 **Seeking angels who believe in gamified AI-augmented edutainment ecosystems at scale.**
Let’s democratize participation. Let’s kaihootify the world. 🌍✨
